# Background:
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It kills more children younger than 5 years old each year than any other infectious disease, such as HIV infection, malaria, or tuberculosis. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays may help confirm the diagnosis.

# Objective:
The aim of this project is to identify pneumonia based on chest X-Ray images. By using computer vision concepts with artificial neural network model.

# Result:
the model successfully identifies 99% of them as PNEUMONIA. In other words, out of all patients who actually have pneumonia, the model correctly identifies almost all of them as PNEUMONIA patients. So, the higher the recall for the PNEUMONIA class, the fewer patients with pneumonia are incorrectly identified as NORMAL patients by the model.
